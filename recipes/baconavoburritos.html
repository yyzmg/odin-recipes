        <li>1 cup diced red potatoes</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups chopped onion</li>

        <li>1 large avocado, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup salsa, or as needed</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt 1 1/2 teaspoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir potatoes in hot butter until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer potatoes to a bowl.</li>
        <li>Melt remaining butter in the same skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion in hot butter until onion is soft and translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer onion to a bowl.</li>
        <li>Beat eggs, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Reduce heat under skillet to medium. Cook and stir eggs in hot skillet until set, 3 to 5 minutes; transfer to a plate.</li>
        <li>Spread tortillas out onto a work surface. Spoon potatoes, onion, eggs, bacon, Cheddar cheese, avocado, salsa, and sour cream in a line across the middle of a tortilla. Fold opposing edges of each tortilla to overlap the filling. Roll 1 of the opposing edges around the filling into a burrito.</li>
